If you're working with WordPress, and you are willing to integrate Leapa into your website, you need to go through the source code and add the Leapa widget. That works fine, but it's not a straightforward process because it requires a little bit of work to get done.

Luckily at Leapa, we don't only care about the user experience of your customers. We do also care about the developer experience who's working on your platforms.

It's in that vision we created Leapa woo-commerce plugin, to make the integration of Leapa into your WordPress website as smooth as possible.
